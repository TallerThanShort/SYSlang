# SYSlang
SYSlang, is an open-source multi-functional coding language.
To import these assets, use
```
lang-imp SYSlang_testV;

from SYSlang_testV enter comm;
from comm enter ya;
from ya enter GUIs;

dl('SYSlang' from(GUIs)).to('A:/');
```

Then reboot into nogui and type any of my GUI names to execute them.

Please note: These files are my personal (and dumb) edit of SYStemware's GUI's, with my personal code editor (inspired by Sublime Text).

I recommended you have at least 1.1 Gib free space for the GUI's + apps that my environments will download and install.
